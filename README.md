ES6 adaptation of [three-bmfont-text](https://github.com/Experience-Monks/three-bmfont-text) and more..

Signed distance fields are a method of reproducing vector shapes from a texture representation, popularized in [this paper by Valve](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf). The integration of signed distance fields into [AngelCode BMFont files](https://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/) enables developers to create high-quality bitmap fonts with smooth, scalable outlines.
